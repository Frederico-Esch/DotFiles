# Remake *musiquinha* in a C, leaving minimum work to scripts

- [x] remake hook in C

- [ ] remake musiquinha states in C
    - current idea: on events write to a /tmp/musiquinha-file-tmp and call the hook that just ```cat``` from it
    - SCRIPTPATH read from env variable

- [x] *MAYBE* add multi screen capabilities
    - It was actually a problem with my *polybar.config* _haha_
